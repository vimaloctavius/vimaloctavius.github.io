First, there is process Visualization. The aspects concerning the activities around Process Visualization are in the top left quadrant. Typically charts, graphs and other visualizations fit in one A3 size paper on print (Yes they're large and a typical A4 size printer will not get the job done). Hardcopies are always reviewed in meetings with multi-colored pens for visual management and flags. Pending outcomes of a meeting are marked with a red pen, checked ones are green. The S3 papers are simply pinned to the board. The next time you meet - you'd always start with the papers from the last meeting and check if the items marked with a red ink are checked to help clear bottlenecks.
